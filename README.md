# 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction System

Multiple Disease Prediction is an advanced Data Science project that leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases, including **Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease**. The system aims to support early diagnosis, assist healthcare providers in decision-making, and reduce the time and cost of traditional diagnostics. The project integrates data preprocessing, machine learning model training, evaluation, and visualization using Streamlit and Power BI.
